495 Checkpoint #2

---The biggest challenge so far was being able to create the layers for the model. I struggle with the errors about not having proper connections. 

----I also had the error of not having the data stored in the proper place so when I tested I originally thought I did super good because I was testing on my train data.
    but once I realized I was using the wrong data I readjusted and then eventually got to 80% accuracy which I’m super stoked about. 

---Initially I had 200 epochs so my program was taking hours to run but once I lowered my epoch down it could finish training quicker. 
    This did lower the accuracy a little but I was surprised with how well the model still performed.
